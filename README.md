# Exercise Goal

Deploy a web app with visualizations on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) as back-end service. Use the web framework [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) which takes care of all the routing needed to organize the web page.

Most of the work involves:

1. Wrangling the chosen dataset extracted from [World Bank API](https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/889392-about-the-indicators-api-documentation) to get the data in the desired format.
2. Writing Python code to read in the data set and set up plots using [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/).
3. Modify HTML using the [Bootstrap library](https://getbootstrap.com) to get the desired website design and information.
